# Usage of include directory

This directory consists all the third party libraries that are need by your project. Usually if
you look into any of the third party libraries present here, they would be following a similar structure that
you are using for your project.
A point to note is there are two ways of using third party libraries in C++ — static and dynamic.
This lib directory is only for static ones.
